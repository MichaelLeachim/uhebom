Okay, this is a data record extraction software.

This system consists of two parts:

* MDR algorithm for extracting data regions from a HTML web page
* [Needleman–Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) algorithm for alignment of data records

The MDR algorithm based on [Mining Data Records](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=956826) paper. 
The implementation is heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/scrapinghub/pydepta) library. 

The alignment part uses this [Needleman–Wunsch](https://github.com/MichaelLeachim/wunsch) implementation. 


## The purpose of this work

The purpose is to provide a fast and portable way to extract 
repeating data in tabular form from HTML pages. 

It should be fast and portable across
